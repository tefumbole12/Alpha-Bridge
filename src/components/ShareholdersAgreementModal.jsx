                 </p>
              </div>

              <AgreementSection title="1. About the Company">

                <p>The value of one (1) share is currently set at <strong className="text-[#003366]">USD $500</strong>. This price is determined by the company's valuation and is subject to change based on future rounds and board approval. The minimum investment is one share.</p>
              </AgreementSection>

              <AgreementSection title="3. When Are Shares Issued?">
                <p>Shares will be officially issued and allocated to the Investor after a vesting period of <strong className="text-[#003366]">24 months (2 years)</strong> from the date of investment receipt. During this period, your investment is treated as Convertible Equity, securing your future ownership stake while the company deploys capital for growth.</p>
              </AgreementSection>

              <AgreementSection title="4. What Does Owning a Share Mean?">
                <p>Investors who purchase shares become partial owners of the company.
